        <p>… help us break the cycle of failure on gun violence.</p>
        
        <p>The Guardian is looking to raise $100K from its readers to fund <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/break-the-cycle" target="_parent">Break the Cycle</a>, our in-depth series to challenge the orthodoxy that gun control is simply too difficult – and promote creative solutions. It’s time for a radically different approach to media coverage of gun violence in the US. </p>
        
        <p>Politicians often insist after mass shootings that “now is not the time” to discuss reform. We believe now is the time. By keeping the issue of gun violence in the public eye, we can drive a conversation and create meaningful change. Your support will fund our in-depth reporting on guns throughout 2018.</p>
